# Weird (for on English speaker) things in Estonian

Here are some weird things about Estonian for me as an English/German speaker. Some of these come out also when Estonian's speak English. 

## Gender

There are no gendered pronouns in Estonian. 

> he/she -> tema

So when Estonians speak English, they can sometimes confuse pronouns.

## The weird 'we'

If my wife wants to tell me that she talked to someone, she might say to me:

> Me rääkisime Kadriga. 

Literally translated that is:

> We talked to her/him.

The "we" here refers to my wife and her friend, and does not mean that multiple people talked to Kadri, which the literal translation would imply.
